# TODO.md - Exploring SQL and Data Types in Oracle

1. **Collect Data**
   - [x] Research and select a dataset related to agricultural production from one of the following sources: CONAB, IBGE, MAPA, Embrapa, INPE, or CNABRASIL.
   - [x] Download the chosen dataset (e.g., historical grain production by state).

2. **Analyze Data and Identify Entities**
   - [x] Identify the main entities, attributes, and relationships in the dataset.
   - [x] Create the Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) based on this analysis.

3. **Normalization**
   - [x] Apply normalization rules (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF) to refine the model, reducing redundancies and eliminating anomalies.

4. **Logical Relational Model**
   - [x] Convert the normalized conceptual model into a logical relational model.
   - [x] Create the diagram for the relational model, including tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

5. **Standardized Naming Convention**
   - [x] Define standardized naming conventions for tables and fields.

6. **Write SQL Code**
   - [x] Create SQL code to generate the database tables, defining primary keys, foreign keys, and integrity constraints.

7. **Develop SQL Queries for Data Analysis**
   - [x] Write SQL queries to analyze the data, such as "Total production of a specific crop by state in a given harvest.", "Evolution of the planted area of a crop over the years", "Ranking of states by productivity in a specific crop.".

8. **Document the Model**
   - [x] Create a data dictionary detailing each table, attribute, and relationships.
   - [x] Prepare explanatory documentation in Markdown (README.md) covering:
     - [x] Project objectives.
     - [x] Description of the created data model.
     - [x] Details of key model components (entities, relationships, and fields).

9. **Delivery**
   - [x] Create and finalize the following deliverables:
     - [x] Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERM).
     - [x] Relational Model Diagram.
     - [x] SQL code file (.sql) for table creation.
     - [x] SQL query file (.sql) for the required analyses.
     - [x] Data Dictionary.
     - [x] README.md documentation.
     - [x] PNG image of the relational model.
     - [x] GitHub repository containing all the above files.
   - [ ] Deliver.
